Files:
- NLP Final Project: Classification - Shows how we formatted our data, set up word2vec embeddings, 
  then fit our data into different baselines and clasffifiers.
- NLP Final Project: LM - Shows how fit our data into language models like BERT in order to attempt 
  to improve accuracy. In this file we ran bert 4 times.  Once with pop as a genre, once without.
  Once with 5 valence bins, once with 2.
